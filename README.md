# odin-recipes
This repository creates a webpage detailing recipes for some dishes.
I do not cook, the recipes are all crafted by chat-gpt, so use them at your own risk XD
This is the first among (hopefully) many of the projects built as a part 
of the curriculum of The Odin Project.
Simply put, I'm learning the ropes of web programming.

In this repository I practice:
- HTML
    + Basic Syntax
