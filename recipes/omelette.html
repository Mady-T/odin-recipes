    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter or cooking oil</li>
        <li>Fillings of your choice (e.g., diced vegetables, cheese, cooked ham, mushrooms, spinach)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep Fillings:</strong> Prepare your choice of fillings. Chop vegetables and any other ingredients you want to add to the omelette.</li>
        <li><strong>Whisk Eggs:</strong> Crack the eggs into a bowl, add a pinch of salt and pepper, and whisk until well combined. You can also add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat Pan:</strong> Place a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add the butter or cooking oil. Allow it to melt and coat the pan evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Pour Eggs into Pan:</strong> Once the butter or oil is hot and shimmering, pour the whisked eggs into the pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Swirl and Cook:</strong> Swirl the pan to spread the eggs evenly. As the edges set, use a spatula to gently lift them, allowing the uncooked eggs to flow to the edges.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Fillings:</strong> Sprinkle your prepared fillings over one half of the omelette. Be creative with your choices!</li>
        <li><strong>Fold and Cook:</strong> Once the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny on top, carefully fold the omelette in half using the spatula. Allow it to cook for another minute or until the eggs are fully cooked.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Slide the omelette onto a plate, and you're ready to enjoy your delicious and customizable omelette!</li>
    </ol>
